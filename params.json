{"name":"NanoCAN Bioinformatics Unit","tagline":"Bioinformatic tools for analysis of high-throughput data to promote cancer research at the NanoCAN center","body":"### NanoCAN Bioinformatics Unit\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this unit is to connect interdisciplinary data-sets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and systematic functional screens, using bioinformatic methods. This approach allows for an encompassing statistical evaluation, which will help to create novel insights into the complex biology of cancer stem cells and relations in cancer development.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal individual bioinformatics solutions are needed for each data generating branch. The tools created here will be published as open source on github. Most notably this involves:\r\n\r\n* [OpenLabFramework](http://nanocan.github.io/OpenLabFramework): A highly flexible laboratory information management system primarily designed to handle libraries of cell line recombinants and vector clones.\r\n* [MIRALCE](http://nanocan.github.io/MIRACLE): A web-based tool for managing reverse phase protein array data efficiently\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
